        Dhaka Ahsania Mission is a non-profit voluntary organization in Bangladesh. The Mission was established in 1958 by Khan Bahadur Ahsanullah,

        every sphere of life–social, economic and cultural; and access to education and resources, he established the Mission. His remarkable educational reforms include among others introduction of roll number system in the public examination
